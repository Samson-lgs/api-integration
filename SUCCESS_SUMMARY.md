# ‚úÖ CPCB Air Quality Data Collection - SUCCESS!

## üéâ What Was Accomplished

Your CPCB air quality data collection system is now **fully operational**! Here's what was successfully completed:

### ‚úÖ Data Collection Status
- **API Key**: Configured and working
- **Data Source**: CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) via data.gov.in
- **Database**: SQLite (no PostgreSQL setup needed!)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY COLLECTING DATA**

### üìä Current Database Statistics
- **Total Monitoring Stations**: 437 stations across India
- **Total Data Points Collected**: 956 readings
- **Pollutants Tracked**:
  - PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5): 137 readings
  - PM10 (Particulate Matter 10): 127 readings
  - NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide): 125 readings
  - SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide): 133 readings
  - CO (Carbon Monoxide): 151 readings
  - O3 (Ozone): 151 readings
  - NH3 (Ammonia): 132 readings

### üìÅ Files Created

1. **cpcb_collector_sqlite.py** - Main data collector (SQLite-based)
2. **query_sqlite.py** - Query and analyze collected data
3. **cpcb_air_quality_data.csv** - Exported data for ML training
4. **air_quality.db** - SQLite database with all collected data
5. **.env** - Configuration with your API key
6. **test_api.py** - API testing utility

## üöÄ How to Use the System

### Collect More Data
```bash
python cpcb_collector_sqlite.py
```
This will fetch the latest 1000 records from CPCB API and add them to your database.

### View and Query Data
```bash
python query_sqlite.py
```
This will:
- Show database summary
- Display latest readings
- Show worst AQI stations
- Show city-wise statistics
- Export data to CSV for ML training

### Use Data for Prediction

The system has already exported data to `cpcb_air_quality_data.csv` which contains:
- Station information (ID, name, city, state, lat/long)
- Timestamp of measurement
- Pollutant type and values (avg, min, max)
- Calculated AQI and category

## üî¨ Next Steps for Air Quality Prediction

### 1. Load the Data
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the exported data
df = pd.read_csv('cpcb_air_quality_data.csv')
print(df.head())
```

### 2. Prepare Features for ML
```python
# Extract time-based features
df['recorded_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['recorded_at'])
df['hour'] = df['recorded_at'].dt.hour
df['day'] = df['recorded_at'].dt.day
df['month'] = df['recorded_at'].dt.month
df['day_of_week'] = df['recorded_at'].dt.dayofweek

# Pivot pollutants into columns
data_pivot = df.pivot_table(
    index=['station_id', 'recorded_at', 'city', 'state'],
    columns='pollutant_id',
    values='pollutant_avg'
).reset_index()
```

### 3. Build Prediction Model
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Prepare features and target
features = ['PM2.5', 'PM10', 'NO2', 'SO2', 'CO', 'OZONE', 'NH3', 'hour', 'day', 'month']
X = data_pivot[features].fillna(0)
y = data_pivot['PM2.5']  # Predict PM2.5 or AQI

# Split and train
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model R¬≤ Score: {score:.4f}")
```

## üìà Key Insights from Current Data

### Worst Air Quality (Severe Category):
- **Delhi** has the worst air quality with PM2.5 levels up to 389 Œºg/m¬≥
- **Anand Vihar, Delhi**: AQI 507 (Severe)
- **Noida/Ghaziabad**: Also showing severe levels

### Best Air Quality (Good Category):
- Coastal cities like **Mumbai** showing better air quality
- Western regions generally better than Northern regions

### Geographic Coverage:
- Data covers major cities across **25+ states**
- Highest concentration in NCR region (Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad)

## üîÑ Automated Collection

To collect data continuously, you can:

1. **Manual Collection**: Run `python cpcb_collector_sqlite.py` whenever needed

2. **Scheduled Collection** (Windows Task Scheduler):
   - Open Task Scheduler
   - Create Basic Task
   - Set trigger (e.g., every hour)
   - Action: Start a program
   - Program: `python`
   - Arguments: `c:\Users\Samson Jose\Desktop\api integration\cpcb_collector_sqlite.py`

3. **Script-based Scheduling**: Use the scheduled_collector.py (requires modification for SQLite)

## üìä Data Export Formats

The system can export data in multiple formats:

### CSV Export (Already Done!)
```python
from query_sqlite import AirQualityQuerySQLite
query = AirQualityQuerySQLite()
query.export_to_csv('my_export.csv')
```

### For ML Training
The exported CSV has all fields needed for:
- Time series forecasting
- Regression models (predict AQI)
- Classification models (predict AQI category)
- Spatial analysis (using lat/long)
- Multi-pollutant correlation analysis

## üéØ Prediction Model Ideas

1. **AQI Forecasting**: Predict next hour/day AQI based on current pollutants
2. **Pollutant Prediction**: Predict PM2.5 levels based on other pollutants
3. **Spatial Prediction**: Predict AQI for locations without sensors
4. **Seasonal Analysis**: Identify patterns by month/season
5. **Alert System**: Predict when AQI will cross dangerous thresholds

## üí° Tips for Better Predictions

1. **Collect More Data**: Run the collector multiple times per day for a week
2. **Add Weather Data**: Combine with temperature, humidity, wind speed
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create lag features (previous hour's values)
4. **Time Series Models**: Use LSTM, ARIMA for sequential predictions
5. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better accuracy
